                        Hello! I am a freshman majoring in Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University. I enjoy exploring the intersections of technology, healthcare, and the arts.
                        <br><br>
                        In high school, I was deeply invovled in STEM outreach, hosting coding workshops for underserved communities to help girls explore their passions in 
                    technology. At the same time, I fostered artistic expression by choreographing dance pieces open to all student, creating a space for creative exploration. 
                    I also developed a strong interest in research and problem-solving, which led me to pursue interdisciplinary projects.
                    <br><br>
                    During the summer before college, I interned at Boeing, working on industrial engineering and additive manufacturing projects. I co-led an Integrated Project Team, 
                    hosted weekly conferences for 65 interns, and facilitated discussions with guest speakers to help students navigate careers in STEM. Now, in college, I continue 
                    applying my technical and analytical skills to research, including AI bias studies and exploratory data analysis, as I work toward a future in medicine.
